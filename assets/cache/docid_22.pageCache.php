Prayer is nothing more than a form of communication with God.

It is through prayer that you can better know God.</p><p>In one of Jesus' famous sermons he taught that when you pray go to your room and close the door (Matthew 6:6).  He advocated praying in private.  By doing so you would remove distraction and concentrate fully on God.  Jesus continued and emphasized getting to the point when praying, instead of 'babbling' as though using many words will make you be heard (Matthew 6:7).  Therefore as you pray, lift up to God what is truly on your heart and be open and honest with Him.  And just like having any effective communication with another person give time to hear what God has to say to you when you pray.</p><p>You may have heard that God knows what is on our hearts before we pray.
