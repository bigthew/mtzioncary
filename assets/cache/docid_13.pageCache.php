Romans 3:10	</p>	<p>	For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 3:23	</p>	<p>	For the sinful nature is always hostile to God.

Romans 2:5	</p>	</li>	<li><strong>JESUS PAID THE PRICE OF SIN FOR YOU BY HIS DEATH ON THE CROSS AND HIS RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD</strong>	<p>	Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.

Romans 5:8	</p>	<p>	You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. Colossians 2:13-14	</p>	</li>	<li><strong>BUT YOU MUST REPENT OF SIN, BELIEVE THE GOSPEL, AND RECEIVE JESUS AS LORD FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF YOUR SIN</strong>.	<p>	The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.  Mark 1:15	</p>	<p>	Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.     Romans 10:9	</p>	<p>	For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  Romans 10:10	</p>	<p>	For everyone who calls on the NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.  Romans 10:13	</p>	<p>	He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  Colossians 1:13-14	</p>	</li>	<li><strong>ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NEED BEFORE GOD	</strong>	<p>	If you have heard the call from God on your life and realize that you are dead in sin without Him, you may now want to respond to His call.  God is calling you to commit your life to Jesus as Lord. Now is the time for you to repent and pray from your heart to God for the forgiveness of your sins in your own words.
