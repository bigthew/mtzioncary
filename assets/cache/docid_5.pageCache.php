Mt. Zion Inc., organized in 1865, is a non-denominational Church committed to be a dynamic spiritual body empowered by the HOLY SPIRIT to share CHRIST with as many people as possible in our lives, church, community, and throughout the world. To exemplify the New Testament model of believers who profess faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:13-18). We are a Bible based congregation that encourages the teaching and training of Christian community through <strong>Worshiping</strong> God freely in spirit and in truth, <strong>Serving</strong>&nbsp; God gladly, <strong>Growing</strong> in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord, and <strong>Reaching Out</strong> to others in order to share the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; The mission of the church is further defined as follows:

</ul>
To be a <strong>SERVING</strong> church that comforts the congregation and community through<br />

	<li>Winning souls for Christ, both people outside the household of faith who have never confessed their faith in Jesus as their personal Savior, and those within the body of Christ who have confessed Him but for various reasons, have strayed away (Matthew 9:37-38; John 10:20-30).</li>
	<li>Spreading the Good News that Jesus loves everyone and there is no sin that cannot be forgiven when it is confessed (John 3:16; Matthew 12:32; Romans 10:9).</li>
