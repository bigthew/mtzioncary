<p>
Proverbs 29:18 tell us &ldquo;where there is no vision, the people perish&rdquo;. God is continually pouring out His vision for Mt. Zion. He is building us up to be a light to the world and a city on a hill that cannot be hidden. 
</p>
<p>
The Lord told Habakkuk to &ldquo;Write the vision, and make it plain&hellip;&rdquo; Although the things God plans may not happen right away. Slowly, steadily, surely, the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled. If it seems slow, wait patiently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that glorifies God in all of its activities.</strong> God is the focus of everything we do. 1 Cor. 10:31 states &ldquo;So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.&rdquo; Worship is a daily part of the life of the church. Authentic worship engages the mind, emotions, and body. Worship is out of balance if it does not pertain to all three. The church understands that our spiritual act of worship is to give our entire selves to God as living sacrifices. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that promotes Christian growth and discipleship.</strong> Members will have various opportunities to grow in the relationship with God through Sunday School, Bible Study, prayer meetings, one-on-one discipleship training, and various classes. The church will help members to discover their gifts and God-given purpose so that the entire body can function properly. Every member will see themselves as a vital part of the church body and will be involved in ministry. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church where the Gospel is spread throughout the community in various forms.</strong> The church has a passion for reaching beyond its four walls to those who are lost and without hope. Events are regularly advertised and opened to the public. The church will use visitations, paper literature, electronic media (CD, DVD), and evangelistic outreach events to reach the lost. The church will also embrace technology such as TV, radio, and the internet to reach people around the world. The church will commit enthusiastically to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that addresses community concerns and issues.</strong> The church is not only concerned about the spiritual but the practical physical issues affecting our community. James 2:15-17 states &ldquo;Suppose you see a brother or sister who needs food or clothing, and you say, &quot;Well, good-bye and God bless you; stay warm and eat well&quot;&mdash;but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do? So you see, it isn't enough just to have faith. Faith that doesn't show itself by good deeds is no faith at all&mdash;it is dead and useless.&rdquo; The church will help those who are hungry, those who need clothing, and those who are in or coming out of prison. The church will keep our congregation informed on health and political issues that affect our community. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that regularly does volunteer work in the community.</strong> Church members give of their time to help at shelters, food banks, and housing programs. The church understands that when physical needs are met, people are more receptive to hearing the Gospel. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that builds and fosters relationships within the community.</strong> The church will work with other organizations to help provide resources that help build up our community. The church will partner, fellowship, and build relationships with other area churches. We will put aside petty differences to work together so we can bring hope, unity, and the Gospel to our community. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church with a multi-ethnic congregation.</strong> The church will promote breaking down cultural walls and barriers therefore allowing people of all ethnicities to be a part of our church family. Despite our diversity and differences, we will enjoy the richest fellowship imaginable because it is based on our common commitment to Jesus Christ. The church will maintain its spirit of love and harmony.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church building that encompasses more classrooms, training facilities, multi-purpose fellowship hall, gymnasium, administrative offices, nursery, and a sanctuary.</strong> The facilities are not the end goal, but it will be a tool to help us fulfill the vision that God has given us. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church where the members are good stewards over the resources that God has given them.</strong> Members are cheerful (hilarious) givers towards the building of God&rsquo;s Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I see a church that knows its primary purpose. </strong>Matthew 28:19-20 tells us: &ldquo;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&rdquo; Our primary call is to preach the Gospel and bring people to salvation in Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can you see what I see?</strong> Join me in pursuing the vision that God has for Mt. Zion. When we have done what God appointed for us, then one day we will joyfully hear, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!&rdquo;
