<b>Revolution 2.1.1 Fixes Package Management Issue, Enhances Security and Much More</b><br /><br />A week ago we released the highly anticipated MODX Revolution 2.1 which added Microsoft SQL Server support, huge performance and caching improvements, the elimination of thousands of lines of long-deprecated code and so much more. It has been our most successful release to date in terms of download statistics. There were more than 5500 downloads in just one week—more than 785 a day! With so many downloads and people using this new version of Revo, it was inevitable and expected we would find a few issues needing to be solved. Thanks to all those who downloaded, deployed and especially to those of you who reported issues and filed feature requests. <br /><br />Here are the highlights of the changes in Revolution &nbsp;2.1.1:<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Corrected an issue with Package Management relating to updates of Extras</li><li>Hardened manager security against CSRF attacks in unlikely case an attacker had previous Administrator credentials. </li>...</ul>

<b>Revolution 2.1 Release Candidate 4: Final Testing before Public Release</b><br /><br />As you may already know, MODX Revolution 2.1 is a huge milestone in the development and future of MODX. From Microsoft SQL Server support to caching improvements to the elimination of thousands of lines of deprecated code, Release Candidate 4 (RC-4) fixes a number of additional issues and bugs identified by community members in the previous Release Candidate.<br /><br />We still need help from the community to ensure MODX Revolution is ready for its official public release. Testing, translations, documentation and updating Add-ons will all be part of this Release Candidate period which closes May 9th, 2011. We encourage you to test and use this release and welcome reports of issues to make sure that 2.1.0-pl will be a near-flawless release.<br /><br /><b>Test and Prepare</b><br />This is a Release Candidate and therefore <i>should not be considered safe for deployment on production servers without thorough testing</i> in a development or test environment....
