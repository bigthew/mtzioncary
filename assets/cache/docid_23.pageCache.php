Maybe you follow us through Zion Live, you watch televised services, read different Christian based material, listen to sermons on CD or find other Christian resources, you still need to become a part of a local church.  The support of a local church gives you the ability to discover and utilize your spiritual gifts.  It also allows you to encourage and become encouraged by like-minded believers.
</p>
<p>
The author of Hebrews wrote that &ldquo;we should not neglect our meeting together, as some do, but encourage others, especially now that the day of His return is drawing near&rdquo; (Hebrews 10:24-25).  Belonging to a local church gives us that ability to prepare.
</p>
<p>
When searching for the right church, pray to God for guidance. You will know you are at the right church when you can feel comfortable about the way you experience God with the other members.  If a church makes you feel uncomfortable, it might be the Holy Spirit telling you this isn&rsquo;t the right place for you.  This is why it is important to allow God to guide you before you act.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of things you should ask yourself when looking for a church:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is this church centered on Christ while teaching from the Bible, the inspired and ONLY infallible Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16)?</li>
	<li>Does this church believe that God exists as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (John 14:26, Matthew 28:18, 19)?</li>
	<li>Is salvation taught as the only way to enter a relationship with God though the acceptance of Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior and repentance of their sins?  That salvation is a free gift from God to anyone (John 14:6, Ephesians 2:8-9).</li>
	<li>Are you encouraged to discover, utilize and grow in your spiritual gifts (Romans 12:3-8)?</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	So if are not a part of a local church or that we you are doesn&rsquo;t meet up with the questions raised above, seek God to find the right local church where God wants you to be.
